# ccp_starter_code
Starter Code for your CCP 
Requirements
You need to complete and submit a link to your HTML code for the Common Class Project.  Here are the requirements:

All of the code must be shared in a repo named ccp_html_w24.
You can start from the same file you used in discussions weeks 2 & 3, but if you worked with a partner make sure you have your own repo for this.
You must include a Skip to Main content link on every page. (See the example starter code)
You must have four pages: index.html, pets.html, travel.html, and recipes.html.
Your index page can contain whatever content you would like.
The pets page must have at least three pets.
The travel page must have at least three locations.
The recipes page must have at least three recipes.
One of those pages should include two extra pets, or two extra locations, or two extra recipes.
This should include headings, images, and text (paragraphs, lists, etc.)
All four pages must link together using a consistent navigation that is an unordered list of links.
This means we need to be able to click on a link in your navigation to get to that page.
You should not have any errors on any of the validators:
Wave 
aXe
W3validator
No CSS is necessary for this assignment - we will not be grading on styling - just html.
You may choose to upload a repo with no CSS files for this assignment to avoid any validator errors - that's fine.
It's okay if it looks ugly - your pictures are likely not the same size at all - that's okay!
